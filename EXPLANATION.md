efishery-test project

First is load data from stein
1. ```https://stein.efishery.com/v1/storages/5e1edf521073e315924ceab4/list```
2. ```https://stein.efishery.com/v1/storages/5e1edf521073e315924ceab4/option_area```
3. ```https://stein.efishery.com/v1/storages/5e1edf521073e315924ceab4/option_size```

Then build form for adding data to redux.
Its position is at the top and very first to be seen, making it easier for users to add data.
The table below it so that the data can look neat and in accordance with the table header.
To change the data in a table, it's easy enough to click the edit button, then the row will change to a field, and an update button will appear.
This kind of display is very easy to use by anyone because it will not be difficult to find it, and for end users they immediately know where they want to input, fill, change, delete data. therefore I made it very simple, and was given a white color to make it look simpler, and the buttons were embellished with an outline of the adjusted colors.
